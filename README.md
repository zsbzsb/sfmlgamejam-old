sfmlgamejam
===========

What needs to be finished:

Polls for chosing a theme
Displaying all jam entries(current and previous) 
Navigation of all jams
controlling various things via the admin page

Making it look good.


What I was working on:
brainstorming things that should be included in the admin page, and how to lay it out
organizing the layout of the sources better(folders for each section)
gettings the pages for viewing the jam entries set up
